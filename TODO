 TODO - other things to be done for Imager::Graph

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over

=item *

other graph types

=item *

better scaling support in the default styles

=item *

some sort of support for handling rounding issues nicely, eg. if the
user supplies 3 equal values then the percentages shown all be "33%"
which doesn't add up to 100%.  I'm not sure what can be done about
that though.

=item *

better space management - the current blocking system is a bit crude
(low priority).  This would probably require some iterative method of
checking for overlaps for different graph elements rather than
blocking down to a box.

=item *

shortcuts for fountain fill segments, ie. instead of having to call:

        Imager::Fountain->simple(positions=>[0, 1], 
                colors=>[ NC('000000'), NC('FFFFF') ])

allow the entry to contain:

       segments=>[ '000000', 'FFFFFF' ]

or even more colors, and provide positions equally spaced from 0 to 1.

=item *

popped out segments (pie charts)

=item *

backgrounds for pie labels

=item *

backgrounds for pie callouts

=item *

break up Imager::Graph::Pie::draw() - too big

=item *

implement label.hpad and label.vpad

=item *

some way to get to the layout of the data, eg. so the user can build
an image map, or possibly an image map generator.

=item *

handle small segments in the pie by making the leaders non-radial

=item *

move more construction to the constructor
